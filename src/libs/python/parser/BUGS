This are known bugs of the parser that should be fixed but are not easy to fix or reproduce:

- unexpected EOF error when parsing automatix.py which shouldn't have a newline at the end of the file for this (or test_runner.py)
	Or use 
"def a():
	i=1
	j=i"

- parser fails ...when no newline is found at end of File.[ a file should end with a newline]

- crash/Assert On editing a small file the one described above. try put a newline before def a().[ Fixed ]

- crash sometimes On editing a file while a DUChain viewer is displaying the contexts.
